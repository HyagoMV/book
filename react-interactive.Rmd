# Interactive React
This chapter how websites built using the React library can be made interactive, with Components that render different content in response to user actions. Specifically, it details how to idiomatically handle _events_, store dynamic information in a Component's _state_, and perform specific actions (such as downloading data) in conjunction with a Component's _lifecycle events_.


## Handling Events in React
You can handle user interaction in React in the same way you would [using the DOM or jQuery](#listening-for-events): you register an _event listener_ and specify a _callback function_ to execute when that event occurs.

In React, you register event listeners by specifying a React-specific attribute on an element. The attribute generally named with the word **`on`** followed by the name of the event you want to respond to in _camelCase_ format. For example, `onClick` registers a listener for `click` events, `onMouseOver` for `mouseover` events, and so on. You can see the full list of supported event handling attributes in the documentation for [synthetic events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events). The attribute should be assigned a value that is a reference to a _callback function_ (specified as an inline expression).

```jsx
//A component representing a button that logs a message when clicked
class MyButton extends Component {
  //method to call when clicked. The name is conventional, but arbitrary
  //the callback function will be passed the DOM event
  handleClick(event) {
     console.log('clicky clicky');
  }

  render() {
    //make a button with an `onClick` attribute!
    //this "registers" the listener and sets the callback
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>;
  }
}

```

This component renders a `<button>` in the DOM with a registered click event. Clicking on that DOM element will cause the component's `handleClick` method to be executed. Note that the method is referenced using the `this` keyword (and no parentheses!), because the reference is to _this Component**'s**_ `handleClick()` method.

Importantly, you can only register events on React elements (HTML elements like `<button>`, that are named with lowercase letters), not on Components. If you tried to specify a `<MyButton onClick={callback}>`, you would be passing a _prop_ that just happened to be called `onClick`, but otherwise has no special meaning! 

<p class="alert alert-warning">Although functionally similar, React event handling attributes are **NOT** the same as HTML event handles&mdash;React's `onClick` is different from HTML's `onclick`. The React attributes are specialized to work within the React event system. In the end, they're similar to a JSX-based syntactic shortcut for using `addEventListener()`, so we aren't actually mixing concerns more!</p>

### Accessing `this` Component from Events
It is very common to have a Component's event callback functions need to reference the instance variables or methods of that component&mdash;such as to do something based with a prop (found in `this.props`) or to call an additional helper method (called as `this.otherMethod()`). In short&mdash;the event callback will need to have access to the `this` context. 

But as discussed in [Section 15.2](#working-with-this), callback functions are not called on any particular object, and thus do not have a value assigned to their `this` variable. In the example above, although you're using the word `this` to _refer to_ the method `this.handleClick` (to tell JavaScript where to find the function), that function is not actually being called on the class. As described in Section 15.2, just because the method was defined inside a class doesn't mean it needs to be called on an instance of that class!

```jsx
//BUGGY CODE: A button that causes and error when clicked!
class MyButton extends Component {
  handleClick(event) {
     //Reference the object's `this.props` instance variable. But since `this`
     //is undefined when executed as a callback, it will cause a
     //TypeError: Cannot read property 'props' of undefined
     console.log("You clicked on", this.props.text)
  }

  render() {
    //Specifies function (which happens to be a class method) as a callback
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.props.text}</button>;
  }
}

//Render the component, passing it a prop
ReactDOM.render(<MyButton text="Click me!"/>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

As such, you will need to make sure to "retain" the `this` context when specifying an event callback function. There are a few ways to do this. 

- First, as described in Chapter 15, an _arrow function_ will utilize the same lexical `this` as the context it is defined in. Thus you can "wrap" the event callback function in an arrow function in order to keep the `this`, calling that method on the `this` instance explicitly:

    ```jsx
    class MyButton extends Component {
      handleClick(event) {
         console.log("You clicked on", this.props.text) //functions as expected!
      }

      render() {
        return (
            <button onClick={(evt) => this.handleClick(evt) }>
                {this.props.text}
            </button>
        )
      }
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `onClick` listener is passed an anonymous callback function (in the form of an arrow function), which does the work of calling the `handleClick()` method on the instance (`this`). In effect, you're defining a "temporary" recipe to register with the event listener, whose one instruction is "follow this other recipe". Notice that this approach also has the bonus feature of enabling you to pass additional arguments to the event callback!

    React does note that this approach can have a performance penalty&mdash;you are creating a new function (the arrow function) every time the component gets rendered, and components may be rendered _a lot_ as you make React apps interactive! This won't be noticeable as you are just getting started, but can begin to make a difference for large-scale applications.
    
- An alternative approach is to use a [**public class field**](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) to define the method. This is an _experimental_ JavaScript syntax&mdash;it is currently being considered for official inclusion in the JavaScript language. However, the Babel transpiler supports this syntax (transforming it into a bound class function), and that support is enabled in Create React App allowing you to use the syntax _for React apps_.

    A _public class field_ is a field (instance variable) that is assigned at value the "top level" of a class, rather than explicitly assigning to a property of `this` in the constructor.

    ```js
    //A class with a public class field
    class Counter {
        x = 0; //assign the value here, not in the constructor
        
        increment() {
            this.x = this.x + 1; //can access the field as usual
        }    
    }
    
    let counter = new Counter();
    counter.increment();
    console.log(counter.x); //outputs 1    
    ```

    But since you can assign any type of value to a field&mdash;including functions&mdash;you can use a public class field and define the event callback, using an arrow function to maintain the bound `this` context:
    
    ```jsx
    class MyButton extends Component {
      //define event callback as a public class field (using an arrow function)
      handleClick = (event) => {
         console.log("You clicked on", this.props.text) //functions as expected!
      }

      render() {
        return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{this.props.text}</button>;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Although somewhat more tricky to read and interpret (particularly if the callback takes no parameters), this approach allows you to specify a bound function (which will have the correct value for `this`), while still being able to reference the function directly when registering the event listener&mdash;without having to wrap it in a separate arrow function. At the time of writing, this approach is the "cool" way that callback functions are specified in React.
    
    
## State
The previous section describes how to respond to user-generated events, but in order for the page to be interactive you need to be able to manipulate its rendered content when that event occurs. 
For example, you could click on a button and show many times it was pressed, select a table column to sort the data by that feature, or select a component in order to show an entirely different "page" of content (see [Chapter 19](#client-side-routing)).

To achieve these effects, a Component will need to keep track of its state or situation&mdash;the number on the counter, how the table is sorted, or which "page" to show. In React, a Component's **state** represents internal, dynamic information about how that Component should be rendered. The state contains data that _changes over time_ (and _only_ such information&mdash;if the value won't change for that instance of a Component, it shouldn't be part of the state!).

React Components must store their state in the `state` instance variable (accessed as **`this.state`**). Unlike props that are specified as inputs to the Component, the state must be initially assigned a value, which should be done in the Component's _constructor_:

```jsx
//A button that tracks how many times it was clicked
class CountingButton extends Component {
  constructor(props) { //the constructor must take a `props` parameter
     super(props)      //the constructor must call superclass constructor

     //initialize the Component's state
     this.state = {
         count: 0 //a value contained in the state
     }
  }

  render() {
    //can _access_ values from the state in the `render()` function
    return <button>You clicked me {this.state.count} times</button>;
  }
}
```

Because Components _inherit_ (extend) the `React.Component` class, their constructors must do the same work as the parent class (so that they can function in the same way). In particular, the constructor must take in a single parameter (representing the props that are passed into the Component). It must then immediately call the parent's version of the constructor (and pass in those props) using `super(props)`. This will cause the props to be setup correctly, so that you can use them as normal.
 
Inside the constructor, you _initialize_ the `this.state` value (and this is usually all you do in the constructor!). The `this.state` value must be a JavaScript Object which can store specific data&mdash;you can't make the state a String or a Number, but an object that can contain Strings and/or Numbers (with keys to label them).

You can access the values currently stored in the state through the `this.state` instance variable. You will usually do this in the `render()` (or in a helper method called by the `render()` function). If a value doesn't get used for rendering, it probably doesn't need to be part of the state!

### State vs. Props
Importantly, a Component's _state_ is different from its _props_. Although state and props make look similar (they are both instance variables you access from the `render()` function), they have very different roles. Many developers get the two confused&mdash;to the point that React has an [FAQ](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html#what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-props) entry about the difference!

The key difference between props and state is:

> `props` are for information that doesn't change from the Component's perspective, including "initial" data. `state` is for information that will change, usually due to user interaction.

Props are the "inputs" into a Component, the values that someone else tells the Component it should. _Props are immutable_&mdash;from the Component's perspective; they cannot be changed once set (though a parent could create a _different_ version of the Component with different props).

State is "internal" to the Component, and is (only) for values that change over time. If the value doesn't change over the life of the Component (e.g., in response to a user event), it shouldn't be part of the state! To quote from [the documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html):

> State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time.

For example, a `SortableTable` component might be used to render a list of data. But as the date in the list would come from elsewhere (e.g., the overall `App`) and wouldn't be changed _by the table_, it would be passed in as a `prop`. However, the _order_ in which that data is displayed might change&mdash;thus you could save an `orderBy` value in the state, and then use that to organize what elements are returned by the `render()` function. The data itself doesn't change, but how it is rendered does!

<!-- Add example? Can do sorting by column-name easily? :/ -->

It is possible to use the props to initialize the state (since props are the "initial values" for the Component), though the props would not be changed later:

```jsx
//A component representing a count
class Counter extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props)
        
        this.state = {
            //set initial state value based on prop
            count: this.props.startAt
        }
    }
}

let counter = <Counter startAt={5} />
```

In this case the `state` keeps track of the count, though the prop specifies an initial number. The `this.state.count` variable will change in the future, but the `this.props.startAt` value will not.

It's important that you _only_ use state to track values that will change over the life of the Component. If you're not sure if a value should be part of the state, consider the following:

1. Is the value passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn't state.
2. Does the value remain unchanged over time? If so, it definitely isn't state.
3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn't state.

The last of these rules is important. In general, you should keep the state as _minimal as possible_&mdash;meaning you want to have a little data as possible in the state as possible. This is to help avoid duplicating information (which can get out of sync), as well as to speed up how React will "re-render" Components when the state changes.

<p class="alert alert alert-warning">One of the most difficult parts of architecting a React application is figuring out what information should be stored in the props or state (and in which Components). We suggest you practice using simple examples, and think carefully about it as you build more robust applications.</p>


### Changing the State
Data is stored in the state so that can be changed over time. You can modify a Component's state by calling the [**`setState()`**](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate) method on that Component. This method usually takes as a parameter an object that contains the new desired values for the state; this set of new values will be "merged" into the existing state, changing only the indicated values (other values will be left alone):

```jsx
//An element that displays the time when asked
class Clock extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props)
     this.state = {
         currentTime: new Date(), //current time
         alarmSound: "annoying_buzz.mp3" //changeable alarm sound
     }
  }

  //callback function for the button (public class field)
  handleClick = (props) => {
     let stateChanges = { 
          currentTime: new Date() //new value to save in the state
     };
     this.setState(stateChanges); //apply the state changes and re-render!
  }
  
  render() {
      return (
          <div>
            <button onClick={this.handleClick}>What time is it right now</button>
            <p>The time is {this.state.currentTime.toLocaleTimeString()}</p>
          </div>
      );
  }
}
```

The `setState()` method will ["merge"](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-are-merged) the values of its parameter into the Component's `state` field; in the above example, the `alarmSound` value will not be modified when the button is pressed; only the value for `currentTime` will be changed. If you want to change multiple values at the same time, you can include multiple keys in the parameter to `setState()`. Also note that this merging is "shallow"&mdash;if you wanted to change a state value that was an array (e.g., `this.state = { comments:[...] }`), you would need to set a brand new version of that array (that could be a modified version of the previous state; see below).
 
Importantly, you _must_ use the `setState()` method to change the state; you [_cannot_](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#do-not-modify-state-directly) assign a new value to the `this.state` instance variable directly. This is because the React framework uses that method to not only adjust the instance variable, but also to cause the Component to "re-render". When the state has finished being updated, React will re-render the Component (causing it's `render()` method to be called again), and merging the updated rendering into the page's DOM. React does this merging in a highly efficient manner, changing the elements that have actually updated&mdash;this is what makes React so effective for large scale systems.

<p class="alert alert-info">Remember: calling `setState()` will cause the `render()` method to be called again, and it will access the updated `this.state` values!</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">Never call `setState()` directly from inside of `render()`! That will cause an infinite recursive loop. The `render()` method must remain "pure" with no side effects.</p>

Moreover, the `setState()` method is [_asynchronous_](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous). Calling the method only sends a "request" to update the state; it doesn't happen immediately. This is because React will "batch" multiple requests to update the state of Components (and so to rerender them) together&mdash;that way if your app needs to make lots of small changes at the same time, React only needs to regenerate the DOM once, providing a significant performance boost.

```jsx
//An Component with a callback that doesn't handle asynchronous state changes
class CounterWithError extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props)
     this.state = {
         count: 3 //initial value
     }
  }

  handleClick = () => {
     this.setState({count: 4}); //change `count` to 4
     console.log(this.state.count); //will output "3"; state has not changed yet!
  }
  
  //...
}
```

In this example, because `setState()` is asynchronous, you can't immediately access the updated state after calling the function. If you want to use that updated value, you need to do so in the `render()` method, which will be called again once the state has finished being updated.

Because `setState()` calls are asynchronous and may be batched, if you wish to update a state value based on the _current_ state (e.g., to have a counter increase), you need to instead pass the `setState()` method a [_callback function_](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous) as an argument (instead of an Object of new values). The callback function will be passed the "current" state (and props), and must `return` the Object that you wish to merge into the state:

```jsx
//An example button click callback
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
     super(props)
     this.state = { count: 0 } //initial value
  }

  handleClick = () => {
     //setState is passed an anonymous callback function
     this.setState((currentState, currentProps) => {
         //return the Object to "merge" into the state
         let stateChanges = {count: currentState.count + 1}; //increment count
         return stateChanges;
     })
  } 
   
  //...
}
```

While trying to use `this.state` directly in a call to `setState()` will _sometimes_ work, best practice is to instead use a callback function as above when the new state value depends on the old.


### Lifting Up State {-}
In React, a component state is purely _internal_ to that component&mdash;neither the Component's parent element nor its children have access to (or are even aware of) that state. State represents only information about that particular component.

Sometimes a child component (i.e., a Component instantiated in the `render()` method) needs some data that is stored in the state&mdash;for example, a `BlogPost` Component might need a data value that is stored in the `Blog`'s `this.state.comments` array. Components can make information available to their children by passing that data in as a _prop_:

```jsx
class Blog {
    constructor(props){
        super(props);
        this.state = {posts: [...]} //initialize the state
    }
    
    render() {                
        return (
            <div>
                <h2>Most Recent Post</h2>

                {/* pass in values from state as a prop */}
                <BlogPost postText={this.state.posts[0]} />
            </div>
        )
    }    
}
```

In this example, the `BlogPost` would be passed the individual "post text" data as a normal prop, without being aware that the data was actually stored in the `Blog`'s state. When that data changes (e.g., when a new post is added), the `render()` function will be called again and the `BlogPost` Component will be re-instantiated with a new value for its prop&mdash;again, without any knowledge that there was a change. From the perspective of the `BlogPost`, there has only ever been a single `postText` value.

While passing state data to a child (as a prop) is easy, communicating state data to a _parent_ or _sibling_ is more complicated. For example, you may want to have a `SearchForm` component that is able to search for data, but want to them have a sibling `ResultsList` component that is able to display the rendered results:

```jsx
<App>
  <SearchForm /> {/* has the data */}
  <ResultsList /> {/* needs the data */}
</App>
```

When confronted with this problem, the best practice in React is to **lift the state up** to the the _closest common ancestor_. This means that instead of having the data be stored in the state of one of the children, you instead store the data in the state of the _parent_. The parent can then pass that information down to the children (as props) for them to use. This way the data always flows "down" the tree.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
# only in html
cat('!["Lift up" the state to the closest common ancestor to share data between sibling elements](img/react/lift-up.gif)')
```

But with the state stored in the parent, the children elements (e.g., the `SearchForm`) may still need a way to interact with that parent and tell it to change its state. To do this, you can have the parent define a function that changes its state, and then pass the child that _callback function_ as a `prop`. The child will then be able to execute that callback prop, thereby telling the parent to do something (such as update its state!)

- It's like the parents write down their instructions, and then hand them to the child to do later!

In the following example, the parent Component (`VotingApp`) store state data about how many times each button has been pressed, passing a callback function (`countClick`) to its child Components (`CandidateButton`). The `CandidateButton` will then execute that callback when they are clicked. Executing this function causes the `VotingApp` to update its state and re-render the buttons, which show updated text based on the props given to them (namely: who is winning!).

```jsx
class VotingApp extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counts: { red: 0, blue: 0 } //initialize state (counts for each color)
    }
  }

  //expects a "color" for which button was clicked
  countClick = (color) => {
    console.log(color);
    this.setState((currentState) => {
      currentState.counts[color]++; //increment that color's count
      return currentState; //new value to assign to state
    })
  }

  render() {
    //render based on current state
    let winner = "tie"; 
    if(this.state.counts.red > this.state.counts.blue) winner = "red"
    else if(this.state.counts.blue > this.state.counts.red) winner = "blue"

    return (
      <div>
        <p>Current winner is: {winner}</p>
        {/* Pass the callback to each button as a prop */}
        <CandidateButton color="red" winner={winner} callback={this.countClick} />
        <CandidateButton color="blue" winner={winner} callback={this.countClick} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class CandidateButton extends Component {
  handleClick = () => {
    //On click, execute the given callback function (passing in own name)
    this.props.callback(this.props.color)
  }

  render() {
    //render based on current props
    let label = "I am not winning";
    if(this.props.winner === this.props.color)
      label = "I am winning!"

    return (
      <button className={this.props.color} onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {label}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

As with many React systems, there are a lot of moving parts that fit together. To understand how this example works, try "tracing" the code that occurs when the `CountingApp` is first rendered, and then what happens when a button is clicked. Remember that calling `setState()` on a Component will cause that Component to be re-rendered! 

Finally, notice in particular that the `CandidateButton` class knows nothing about its parent or indeed any information about how it is used (or even if there are other `CandidateButton` instances). Instead, it simply renders itself based on its props, and executes whatever `callback` function it was given whenever it is clicked (without carrying about what that function does).

In summary, in order to make an interactive React application, perform the following steps:

1. Start with a "static" (non-interactive) version, with appropriate Components
2. Identify variables that will change so need to be stored in the `state`
3. Put `state` in the "lowest" common ancestor for Components that need it
4. Pass `state` information to child Components as `props`
5. Pass _callback functions_ as `props` to child Components so they can modify the state.

### Working with Forms
One of the most common reasons to track state in a React app is when developing [forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) that the user can fill out to submit information. Forms are a common structure to use when getting user input&mdash;whether it's a "search form" for browsing a data set, or a "login form" for allowing a user access to personalized data.

In normal HTML, form elements such as **`<input>`** keep track of their own "state". For example, whatever the user has typed into a text input will be stored in that input's `value` property:

```js
//Select the <input type="text"> element
let textInput = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');

//Event that occurs whenever the input is changed
textInput.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    let input = event.target;
    console.log(input.value); //access that elements "state"
});
```

You will often want React to be able to respond to user data entered into a form&mdash;either because you want to send an AJAX request based on that data, or because you want to perform **form validation** and confirm that the user has entered appropriate input (e.g., that the password is at least 6 characters long). But storing the user input in the `<input>` element's state can cause problem for React: React components won't know when to update when that changes, and updating a React component might cause the entire DOM tree to re-render (producing a new `<input>` element with a different `value` state).

Thus the recommended practice for working with forms in React is to use [**controlled Components**](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). In this case, you define a Component that will track the state of what the user has typed into the `<input>`, and then will render an `<input>` with an appropriate `value` property. Rather than letting the `<input>` control its own state, the React component controls the state and then dictates to the `<input>` element what value it should be showing. It's like React is snatching the data from the `<input>` and then claiming credit for it.

```jsx
class MyInput extends React.Component {
   constructor(props) {
      super(props)
      this.state = {value: ''} //track the input's value in the state
   }

   //respond to input changes
   handleChange = (event) => {
      //get the value that the <input> now has
      let newValue = event.target.value

      //store that new value in the state, rendering the Component
      this.setState({value: newValue});
   }

   render() {
      return (
         <div>
            {/* The input will be rendered with the React-controlled value */} 
            <input type="text" onChange={this.handleChange} value={this.state.value} />
            <p>You typed: {this.state.value}</p>
         </div>
      );
   }
}
```

The above is an example of a basic controlled Component. When the user enters a different value into the `<input>` element, the `handleChange()` callback is executed. This grabs that updated value and saves it in the Component's state. Updating the state then causes the `render()` function to execute again, which recreates a brand new version of the `<input>` element, but displaying the React-controlled `value`. This way whatever value the user has entered will always be part of a React Component's state, and so can be manipulated and interacted with in the same manner.

- And of course, a controlled form might render multiple `<input>` elements, tracking the values of each one in a separate value in the state. This also allows the inputs to easily interact with each other, such if you want to confirm that a password was entered correctly twice.

- Robust form validation is actually quite tricky in React (especially when compared to other frameworks such as Angular). Using an external library such as [Formik](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik) can help with developing forms and handling all the edge cases.


## The Component Lifecycle
A react component's state is initialized in the constructor (when the component is first instantiated), and then usually modified in response to user events (by calling the `setState()` method). But there are a number of other "events" that occur during the life of a Component&mdash;such as the "events" of when the Component is added to the DOM ("mounted") or removed from the DOM ("unmounted"). For example, you should only download data when there is a Component on the screen to display that data (after the Component has been added to the DOM), and to "clean up" any listeners or timers when the Component is removed.
It is possible to define functions will execute at such these events, allowing you to perform specific actions as the React framework manipulates the DOM. These functions are called [**lifecycle methods**](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#adding-lifecycle-methods-to-a-class)&mdash;they are methods that are executed at different stages of the Component's "lifecycle". You _override_ these lifecycle methods in order to specify what code you want to run at those events. Lifecycle methods will be _automatically executed by the React framework_; you never directly call these methods (the same way you never directly call `render()`&mdash;which is itself a lifecycle method!)

React components have a number of different lifecycle methods, the most common of which are illustrated below:

```jsx
//A generic component
class MyComponent extends Component {
  //The constructor is called when the Component is instantiated, but before_body
  //it is added to the DOM (on the screen)  
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    //initialize state here!
  }

  //This method is called when the Component has been added to the DOM (and
  //is visible on the screen). This occurs _after_ the first `render()` call.
  componentDidMount() {
    //do (asynchronous) setup work, including AJAX requests, here!
  }
  
  //This method is called when a Component is being "re-rendered" with a
  //new set of props. This is a less common method to override
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    //do additional "re-setup" work (including updated AJAX requests) here!
  }

  //This method is called when the Component is about to be removed from the DOM
  //(and thus will no longer be visible on the screen)
  componentWillUnmount() {
    //do (asynchronous) cleanup work here!
  }  
}
```

For more details on the specific usages (and parameters!) of these methods, see the [official API documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle). 

<!-- Is there more to say about this? :/ -->

Note that you are not _required_ to include these methods in a Component. However, they are required to correctly perform asynchronous functions such as AJAX requests, as described below.


### Lifecycle Example: Fetching Data via AJAX
One of the most common use of lifecycle callback functions is when accessing data asynchronously, such as when fetching data via an AJAX request (such a described in [Chapter 14](#ajax)). This section provides details about how to asynchronously load data within the React framework.

First, remember that React code is _transpiled_ using Webpack. As such, some APIs&mdash;including `fetch()` are not "built-in" to React like they are with a modern browser. As discussed in [Chapter 14](#fetching-data), in order to support these "other" browsers, you will need to load a _polyfill_. You can do that with React by installing the `whatwg-fetch` library, and then `import`ing that polyfill in your React code:

```bash
# On command line, install the polyfill
npm install whatwg-fetch
```

```js
//In your JavaScript, import the polyfill (loading it "globally")
//This will make the `fetch()` function available
import 'whatwg-fetch';
```

Remember that `fetch()` downloads data _asynchronously_. Thus if you want to download some data to display, it may take a while to arrive. You don't want React to have to "wait" for the data (since React is designed to be _fast_). Thus the best practice is to send the `fetch()` request for data, and `then` when the data has been downloaded, call the `setState()` method to update the Component with the downloaded data. (The Component can initialize its state as an "empty array" of data).

Because `fetch()` will eventually call the `setState()` method, you can't send the AJAX from the Component's constructor. That's because `setState()` will eventually render the Component, which involves updating something that has been added to the DOM. In the constructor, the Component has been instantiated, but has not yet been added to the DOM&mdash;thus you can't update its state yet! If the data ends up downloading before the Component is mounted, you will get an error that you cannot re-render an unmounted Component!

Instead, you should always send your (initial) `fetch()` requests from the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle method. This way the data will only be downloaded once the Component has actually been added to the DOM, and so is available for re-rendering. This structure is shown in the example below:

```jsx
class MyComponent extends Componet {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
        data: [] //initialize data as "empty"
    }; 
  }

  componentDidMount() {    
    fetch(dataUri) //send AJAX request
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => {
        let processedData = data.filter(...).map(...) //do desired processing
        this.setState({data: processedData}) //change the state, and re-render
      })
  }

  render() {
    //Map the data values into DOM elements
    //Note that this works even before data is loaded (when the array is empty!)
    let dataItems = this.state.data.map((item) => {
      return <li key={item.id}>{item.value}</li>; //return DOM version of datum
    })

    //render the data items (e.g., as a list)
    return <ul>{dataItems}</ul>; 
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `this.state.data` is initialized as an empty array; this will `render()` just fine (it produces an empty list). Once the Component is mounted, the data will be downloaded and processed, and then saved as an updated state value. Calling `setState()` will cause the Component to re-render, so that the data will be displayed as desired! While technically it means the Component is rendering twice, React can batch these requests together so that if the data downloads fast enough, the user will not notice.
